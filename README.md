## Activities
- Identified main computer hardware components such as CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage device, power supply, and casing  
- Assembled the PC components step by step during the lab session  
- Connected internal cables and external peripherals  
- Powered on the system and checked whether the computer functioned correctly  

## What I Learned
From this lab activity, I learned the function of each hardware component and how they work together in a computer system. I also gained practical experience in assembling a PC and understood the importance of proper handling and correct installation of components.

## Suggestions for Improvement
The lab session could be improved by allocating more time for hands-on practice and providing more PC sets so that every student can gain more direct experience.

## Reflection
Overall, the PC Assemble lab helped me apply theoretical knowledge to real practice. It increased my confidence in handling computer hardware and enhanced my practical skills, which are useful for future studies and IT-related careers.

# Design Thinking

## Activities
- Identified a problem based on user needs  
- Applied the design thinking stages such as empathize, define, ideate, and prototype  
- Created a low fidelity prototype using sketches and simple layouts  
- Presented the prototype and received feedback for improvement  

## What I Learned
Through this activity, I learned how design thinking helps in understanding user problems before creating solutions. I also learned that low fidelity prototypes are useful for quickly testing ideas and gathering feedback without using complex tools. This activity improved my creativity, problem-solving skills, and teamwork.

## Suggestions for Improvement
The activity could be improved by allowing more time for brainstorming and prototype refinement, as well as providing more examples of real-world design thinking applications.

## Reflection
Overall, this design thinking activity helped me understand the importance of user-centered design in technology development. It encouraged me to think creatively and consider user needs when designing solutions, which is important for my future studies and career in the IT field.
